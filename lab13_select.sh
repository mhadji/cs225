# Objective: Create a script with four functions using BASH's in process
# regular expressions to check the validity of email addresses, telephone numbers, IP addresses and credit card numbers 
#based on each particular data format.


#!/bin/bash

# Each function will return a message and a 1 or 0 depending on the outcome of the comparison
# Make sure the script traps control-c and exits
